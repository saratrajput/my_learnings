Random word: fur
Fur is soft. Dogs have furs. Furs protect them from cold. Humans used to have lots
of hair as fur. But now we don't need them as we have made clothes. So many
people have started losing their hair. It's ironic how we use other animal's
furs to make clothes for us as we have lost our own fur. In the future, we all
might become completely hairless. Furs have some problems too. As fur holds in
the sweat, it creates a lot of smell. Fur has a nice texture on it. Long furs
can be illustrious.
